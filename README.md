# soulutf8

soulutf8 package for latex


This repository is a fork of https://github.com/drehscheibe/soul

Currently the files forked from soul are unused.
Just used to build the extension soulutf8 originally by Heiko Oberdiek.

## soulutf8

This package extends package soul and adds some support
for UTF-8. Namely the input encodings utf8.def
from package inputenc and
package ucs's utf8x.def are supported.
